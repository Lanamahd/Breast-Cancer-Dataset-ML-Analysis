# Breast Cancer Dataset ML Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the **Breast Cancer Dataset** using Machine Learning techniques. The analysis is conducted using **Jupyter Notebooks**, providing insights into the data and building predictive models to classify and analyze breast cancer cases effectively.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the breast cancer dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for machine learning models.
- **Model Building**: Implement and evaluate various machine learning models for classification.
- **Visualization**: Generate visualizations to better understand the dataset and model performance.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive and well-documented notebooks for reproducibility.

## Tech Stack
- **Jupyter Notebook**: 100% of the project is implemented using Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Python Libraries**: Commonly used libraries for data science and machine learning (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## Dataset
The project uses the **Breast Cancer Dataset**, which contains labeled data for breast cancer classification. This dataset is commonly used for machine learning tasks and includes attributes such as mean radius, mean texture, perimeter, area, and diagnosis labels.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
- Common Python libraries for data science (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lanamahd/Breast-Cancer-Dataset-ML-Analysis.git
   cd Breast-Cancer-Dataset-ML-Analysis

2. Install the required libraries:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook

4. Open the notebook file (.ipynb) in the browser and follow the instructions to execute the cells.

## Usage
1. Load the dataset into the data/ directory.
2. Use the Jupyter Notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to:
